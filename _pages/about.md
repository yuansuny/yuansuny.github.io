I am a Research Fellow at the School of Mathematics, Monash University. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, RMIT University. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from The University of Melbourne, Australia, and a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Peking University, China. My research interests include machine learning, combinatorial optimisation, mathematical programming, evolutionary computation and large-scale optimisation. My research has been published in prestigious journals and conferences such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TEVC, EJOR, OR Spectrum, AAAI, ICLR and VLDB. <br/>
