I joined the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, RMIT University as a Postdoctoral Fellow in July 2018. Here I am working on an ARC (Australian Research Council) Discover Project, using hybrid methods (a combination of traditional and artificial intelligence techniques) to solve large-scale optimization problems. Prior to that I obtained my Ph.D degree from University of Melbourne and a Bachelor's degree from Peking University.

My research interests lie in applied mathmatics, particularly in optimization and operations research, evolutionary computation and machine learning. <br/>
