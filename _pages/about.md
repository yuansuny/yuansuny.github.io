I am a Research Fellow at the School of Mathematics, Monash University. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, RMIT University. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from The University of Melbourne, Australia, and a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Peking University, China. My research interests include machine learning, combinatorial optimisation, mathematical programming, evolutionary computation and large-scale optimisation. My research has been published in prestigious journals and conferences such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TEVC, OR Spectrum, AAAI, ICLR and VLDB. <br/><br/><br/>

Other professional activities
======
* I am the Vice-Chair of IEEE Taskforce on Large-scale Global Optimization since January 2020. The objective of this taskforce is to promote research and development of effective techniques for solving large-scale optimisation problems. 
* Journal article reviewing: 
  - IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation  
  - IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
  - IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems 
  - Swarm and Evolutionary Computation
  - Applied Soft Computing
* Conference organisation: I have served as a program committee member of the 31th Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 2018. As vice-chair of the IEEE taskforce, I have co-organised a special session and a tutorial on large-scale optimisation at 2020 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, which is one of the largest and most important conferences in evolutionary computation. I have also regularly reviewed papers for the main conferences in machine learning and evolutionary computation, such as Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, ACM Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, and IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation.
