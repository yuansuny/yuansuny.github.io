I am a postdoctoral researcher at RMIT University. I obtained my Ph.D degree from University of Melbourne in 2018 and Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2013. My research interests lie in applied mathmatics, particularly in optimization and operations research, evolutionary computation and machine learning. <br/>

See my [CV](https://yuansuny.github.io/files/YUANSUN_CV.pdf) for more information. 

__For COSC1027/2033 students, a number of research projects is available [here](https://yuansuny.github.io/projects).__
