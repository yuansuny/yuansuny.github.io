I joined the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, RMIT University as a Postdoctoral Fellow in July 2018. Here I am working on an ARC (Australian Research Council) Discover Project, using hybrid methods (a combination of traditional and artificial intelligence techniques) to solve large-scale optimization problems. Prior to that I obtained my Ph.D degree from University of Melbourne in April 2018 and Bachelor's degree from Peking University in July 2013. I received the "Chinese government award for outstanding self-financed student study abroad" for my Ph.D [dissertation](https://yuansuny.github.io/files/PHD_Thesis_Yuan_Sun.pdf). 

See my [CV](https://yuansuny.github.io/files/YUANSUN_CV.pdf) for more information.


My research interests lie in applied mathmatics, particularly in optimization and operations research, evolutionary computation and machine learning. <br/>
