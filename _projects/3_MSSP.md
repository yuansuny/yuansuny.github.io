## <span style="display:block;text-align:center;color:navy"> 3. Multi-shot solution prediction for combinatorial optimisation </span>  


Many real-world problems can be formulated as combinatorial optimization. Tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems typically requires specific algorithmic design with extensive domain knowledge. To alleviate human effort in this costly process, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for combinatorial optimisation has attracted a lot of attention recently. In particular, ML models have been developed to automatically predict the optimal solutions for combinatorial optimisation problems.
