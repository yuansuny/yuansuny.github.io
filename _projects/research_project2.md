__ARC Discovery Project__ <br/>

The aim of this project is to aggregate powerful techniques from different domains, e.g., machine learning, operations research and metaheuristics, to tackle large scale combinatorial optimization problems. So far, we have developed two pieces of work along this line: <br/>

1. We have used data mining and machine learning techniques to reduce a given problem size. An existing solution method can then be used to solve the reduced problem. <br/>

1. We have used Lagrangian Relaxation to decompose a large mixed integer program into a series of easy problem instances that can be solved quickly. The Lagrangian dula problem is solved by metaheuristics. <br/>
