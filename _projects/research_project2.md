__ARC Discovery Project__ <br/>

The aim of this project is to aggregate powerful techniques from different domains, e.g., machine learning, operations research and meta-heuristics, to tackle large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. So far, we have developed two pieces of work along this line: <br/>

1. We have used data mining and machine learning techniques to reduce the size of a given large problem. An existing solution method can then be used to solve the reduced problem. <br/>

1. We have used Lagrangian Relaxation to decompose a large mixed integer program into a series of easy problem instances that can be solved quickly. The Lagrangian dual problem is solved by meta-heuristics. <br/>
