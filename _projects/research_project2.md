__ARC Discovery Project__ <br>

The aim of this project is to aggregate powerful techniques from different domains, e.g., machine learning, operations research and meta-heuristics, to tackle large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. So far, we have developed two pieces of work along this line. <br>

We have used data mining and machine learning techniques to reduce a given large problem to a size that is manageable by existing algorithms. We then can apply any existing solution methods to solve the reduced problem.  <br>

We have used Lagrangian Relaxation to decompose a large mixed integer program into a series of easy problem instances that can be solved quickly. We have used meta-heuristics to search for the optimal values of Lagrange multipliers. <br>
