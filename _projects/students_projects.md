* Evolutionary Machine Learning <br/>

  Evolutionary algorithms as a generic optimization technique can be used to train a machine learning model. The goal here is to use evolutionary algorithms to improve classification accuracy or improve the robustness of model. 
  
  

* Design problem-specific search operators for combinatorial optimization.

* Design decomposition methods for large-scale optimization problems.

* Design effective evolutionary algorithms with domain knowledge.

* Hybridize evolutionary algorithms with traditional methods.
