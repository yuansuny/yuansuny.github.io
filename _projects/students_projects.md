* Evolutionary Machine Learning <br/>

  Evolutionary algorithms as a generic optimization technique can be used to train a machine learning model. For example, in a recent published [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_OEC.pdf), a number of evolutionray algorithms have been used to train an 
optimal-margin classifier, and evolutionary algorithms are found to be superior than triditional methods in terms of classification accuracy, although evolutionary algorithms can be 20 times slower. In another [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_EGAN.pdf), an evolutionary algorithm with problem specific operators (i.e., crossover and mutation) is proposed to tune a hyper-prameter for Generative Adversarial Networks. 
  
  
  
  The goal here is to use evolutionary algorithms to improve classification accuracy or improve the robustness of model. 
  
  

* Design problem-specific search operators for combinatorial optimization.

* Design decomposition methods for large-scale optimization problems.

* Design effective evolutionary algorithms with domain knowledge.

* Hybridize evolutionary algorithms with traditional methods.
