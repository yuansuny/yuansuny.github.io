* Evolutionary Machine Learning  <br/>

Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) as a generic optimization technique can be used to train a machine learning model. For example, in a recent published [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_OEC.pdf), a number of EAs have been used to train an optimal-margin classifier, and EAs are found to be superior than traditional methods in terms of classification accuracy, although they can be 20 times slower. 

The goals of this project are 1) re-producing the results from an existing paper; 2) identifying the limitation of existing work and addressing the limitation 3) extending the existing work by considering more EAs and/or more machine learning models; and 4) designing problem-specific operators (i.e., crossover, mutation and selection etc.) for a given training task. 
  

* Design problem-specific search operators for combinatorial optimization.

* Design decomposition methods for large-scale optimization problems.

* Design effective evolutionary algorithms with domain knowledge.

* Hybridize evolutionary algorithms with traditional methods.

In another [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_EGAN.pdf), an EA with problem specific operators (i.e., crossover and selection) is proposed to tune a hyper-parameter for Generative Adversarial Networks.
