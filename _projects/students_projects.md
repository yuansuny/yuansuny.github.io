* Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization  <br/>
  Combinatorial optimization has lots of applications in practice. However, applying Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to effectively solve combinatorial problems is not straight-forwad. Typically, specific representation, crossover and mutation operators are required in order to generate feasible solutions. The specifically-designed operators are usually of vital importance to the success of EAs when used to solve a given problem.  <br/>
  
  The goals of this project are 1) finding an interesting combinatorial optimization problem to work on, e.g., maximum clique problem, graph colouring etc; 2) designing specific genetic operators for solving the problem; 3) evaluating the proposed algorithm using numerical simulations; 4) comparing the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-arts (e.g., EAs, heuristics and exact methods). 
  
* Evolutionary Machine Learning  <br/>
    Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) as a generic optimization technique can be used to train a machine learning model. For example, in a recent published [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_OEC.pdf), a number of EAs have been used to train an optimal-margin classifier, and EAs are found to be superior than traditional methods in terms of classification accuracy, although they can be 20 times slower. <br/>

    The goals of this project are 1) re-producing the results from an existing paper; 2) identifying the limitation of existing work and addressing the limitation 3) extending the existing work by considering more EAs and/or more machine learning models; and 4) designing problem-specific operators (i.e., crossover, mutation and selection etc.) for a given training task. 
  

* Evolutionary Feature Selection  <br/>
  In machine learning tasks, the number of features in a given dataset can be very large, e.g, gene expression data. However, most of these features are irrelevent and redundent, which significantly slow down the training process and degrade the training accuracy. A logical way to deal with this issue is by dimensionality reduction, i.e., selecting a subset of features for training and testing. This feature selection problem can be easily modeled as an unconstraint optimization problems with binary variables, which is ideal for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve. <br/>
  
  The goals of this project are 1) modeling feature selection problems as a binary optimization problems; 2) selecting an EA and adapting it for the feature selection tasks; 3) evaluating the proposed feature selection model using multiple benchmark datasets and classifiers; and 4) comparing the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts.
