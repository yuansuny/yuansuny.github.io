* Evolutionary Machine Learning <br/>

Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) as a generic optimization technique can be used to train a machine learning model. For example, in a recent published [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_OEC.pdf), a number of EAs have been used to train an optimal-margin classifier, and EAs are found to be superior than traditional methods in terms of classification accuracy, although they can be 20 times slower. In another [paper](http://yuansuny.github.io/files/Rpaper_EGAN.pdf), an EA with problem specific operators (i.e., crossover and selection) is proposed to tune a hyper-parameter for Generative Adversarial Networks.
  

* Design problem-specific search operators for combinatorial optimization.

* Design decomposition methods for large-scale optimization problems.

* Design effective evolutionary algorithms with domain knowledge.

* Hybridize evolutionary algorithms with traditional methods.
